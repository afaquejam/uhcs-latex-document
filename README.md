UHCS Latex Document Template
===================================
A latex document template for (everyone) UHCS students.

Contents
-----------
* A moderately fancy cover page to quickly impress your document readers!
* General document body containing templates for references too!

Usage
------
Just clone this project and open the project files using the latex editor of
your choice. You can also use some online latex editors and compilers such as
Sharelatex.

This could serve as a general document template as well. Just replace the
uh_logo.png with your desired logo. Make some changes in the coverpage and
you're good to go.

Unix/Linux Users
-----------------
First of all, make sure texlive is installed on your machine. A makefile has
been created for command line users. Yay :). Edit the latex files using the
editor of your choice.

To compile and generate a PDF file, simply run this command:

	make

And to clean the project:

	make clean

Feedback and contributions are welcome.

Cheers,
Afaque.
